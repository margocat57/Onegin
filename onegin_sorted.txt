he had the headache;
he has exchanged salutes; then at the stage
he has flown up the marble steps,
he has scanned all the tiers;
he has seen everything; with faces, garb,
he lost at last his liking
he noticed nothing.
he settled down with the laudable aim
he spent in front of glasses,
he walks — on people's toes — between the stalls;
he's dreadfully displeased;
he's driving home to dress.
